%% Assume that the x[n] is the time domain cosine signal of frequency f_c=10Hz 
% that is sampled at a frequency f_s=32*fc for representing it in the computer memory.

fc=10;              % frequency of the carrier
fs=32*fc;           % sampling frequency with oversampling factor=32
t=0:1/fs:2-1/fs;    % 2 seconds duration
x=cos(2*pi*fc*t);   % time domain signal (real number)

%% Lets consider taking a N=256 point FFT, which is the 8^{th} power of 2.
N=256;              % FFT size
X = fft(x,N);       % N-point complex DFT
% output contains DC at index 1, Nyquist frequency at N/2+1 th index
% positive frequencies from index 2 to N/2
% negative frequencies from index N/2+1 to N

% Due to Matlabâ€™s index starting at 1, the DC component of the FFT decomposition is present at index 1.
X(1)
% 1.1762e-14   (approximately equal to zero)



%% Therefore, from the frequency resolution, the entire frequency axis can be computed as
% Each point/bin in the FFT output array is spaced by the frequency resolution df, that is calculated as
% df = f_s/N 
% calculate frequency bins with FFT
df=fs/N                 % frequency resolution
sampleIndex = 0:N-1;    % raw index for FFT plot
f=sampleIndex*df;       % x-axis index converted to frequencies

%% Now we can plot the absolute value of the FFT against frequencies as
subplot(3,1,2); stem(sampleIndex,abs(X)); %sample values on x-axis
title('X[k]'); xlabel('k'); ylabel('|X(k)|');
subplot(3,1,3); plot(f,abs(X)); %x-axis represent frequencies
title('X[k]'); xlabel('frequencies (f)'); ylabel('|X(k)|');

%% fftshift
%two-sided FFT with negative frequencies on left and positive frequencies on right
%following works only if N is even, for odd N see equation above
X1 = [(X(N/2+1:N)) X(1:N/2)]; %order frequencies without using fftShift
X2 = fftshift(X);%order frequencies by using fftshift

df=fs/N; %frequency resolution
sampleIndex = -N/2:N/2-1; %raw index for FFT plot
f=sampleIndex*df; %x-axis index converted to frequencies
%plot ordered spectrum using the two methods
figure;subplot(2,1,1);stem(sampleIndex,abs(X1));hold on; stem(sampleIndex,abs(X2),'r') %sample index on x-axis
title('Frequency Domain'); xlabel('k'); ylabel('|X(k)|');%x-axis represent sample index
subplot(2,1,2);stem(f,abs(X1)); stem(f,abs(X2),'r') %x-axis represent frequencies
xlabel('frequencies (f)'); ylabel('|X(k)|');
