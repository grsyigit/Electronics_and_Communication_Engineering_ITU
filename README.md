My name is Yiğit Bektaş Gürsoy. As of June 2023, I graduated from Istanbul Technical University, Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering. I created this repo to guide people in Electronics and Communications engineering and to better prepare for exams. The names and codes of the courses are written in folders. All kinds of assignments, quizzes, finals and their solutions are also available in addition to lecture notes. For reference, I am sharing the letter grades I enrolled from the course below. If you have questions, I leave my e-mail below, you can reach me from there.
