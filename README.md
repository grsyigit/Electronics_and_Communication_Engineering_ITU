My name is Yigit Bektas Gursoy. As of June 2023, I graduated from Istanbul Technical University, Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering. I created this repo to help people who will be reading this chapter. The names and codes of the courses are written in folders. All kinds of assignments, quizzes, finals and their solutions are also available in addition to lecture notes. If you have questions, I leave my e-mail below, you can reach me from there.
