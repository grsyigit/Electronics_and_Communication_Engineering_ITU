Ödev Açıklaması
Do a research and explain the Call/Return Stack and Interrupts in Picoblaze.

Using Fidex, write an assembly code including nested interrupts (interrupt calling interrupts). Perform nested interrupts by an I/O port.

1- Write 10 nested interrupts and show that Program Counter (PC) returns the initial instruction address (first callee) after 10 returns.

2- Write 32 nested interrupts and observe the consequences.

Connect an I/O port to the interrupt input and implement your design in Vivado. An example top module and a simulation file is provided (out_port(7) is connected to interrupt input). 

Make a simulation and show your results in the time diagram. Include address (PC), interrupt enable and interrupt objects in the time diagram.

 

Include your report:

- Explanation of Call/Return Stack and Interrupts,

- Assembly Code and Explanation,

- Simulation results in Vivado for both cases,

- Make comments about the results you obtained.
